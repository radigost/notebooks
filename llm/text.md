The current state of Artificial Synapse is still in its preliminary stages. Research is mainly focused on three- and multiple-terminal synaptic transistors. There are four main types of synapses being studied: those based on electrical, optical, mechanical, and hybrid properties. The development of artificial synapses is crucial for the construction of biocompatible electronic devices towards artificial intelligence systems. Some of the applications of artificial synapses include various sensory systems, bioplastic bionics, and logical transformation [^1^].


\n\nAs for patents in the field of Artificial Synapse, it's a bit more complex. There are several significant works in the field. For instance, there is research on artificial synapses based on polyimide with embedded graphene quantum dots. This memristor-type artificial synaptic device shows great potential in neuromorphic networks [^3^]. Another study discusses the construction of an artificial synapse within one molecule length scale, which is used in reservoir computing [^5^]. There's also work on synaptic devices based on electrical and optical signals that could be significant for building efficient neuromorphic systems [^4^].

\n\nPlease note that while these are significant works in the field, it's not clear if they are patented or not. For specific patent information, you may need to consult a patent database or a legal professional.

Sangwan & Mark C. Hersam\nIntroduction\nCognition and memory are the main sources of human intelligence. Therefore, human beings have vigorously developed intelligent electronics to imitate biological functions such as the multifunctional sensing and processing of neural signal transmission, storage and feedback. Even though the standard von Neumann architecture has given our software a literally free increase in performance by increasing the speed of every single component, the problem of a separate central processing unit and storage area limiting transmission speed remains a challenge1,2,3. In addition, high latency, excessive energy consumption and insufficient parallelism have become bottlenecks. In contrast, biological synapses control the plastic strength of connections between anterior and posterior neurons to realize data transmission4. Therefore, the neuromorphic system provides a novel efficient solution for processing large amounts of complex data. In this system, neuromorphic devices are applied to simulate synaptic plasticity, using electrical property changes to simulate the connection strength of biological synapses5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50. There are various structures of synaptic devices, including two-, three- and multiple-terminal structures, where the signal transmission path and weight modulation are different51. Typical two-terminal devices, such as memristors, phase-change memories, and atomic switches, can reach a small size and be integrated easily due to their simple structure34,52,53,54,55,56,57,58. In this architecture, the signal transmission and learning process perform asynchronously due to the lower number of terminals; thus, the signal is inhibited during the learning operation with the output signal as feedback to the synaptic device59,60,61,62,63,64. In comparison, three- and multiple-terminal synaptic transistors can not only realize signal transmission and self-learning processes simultaneously but also demonstrate high stability, repeatability and clear operating mechanisms19,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83. Figure 1 shows a comparison between an artificial neural network and a biological network. At present, research on three- and multiple-terminal synaptic transistors is still preliminary, and neuromorphic transistors have mainly focused on four types: synapses based on floating gate-regulated, ferroelectric, photoelectric and electromechanical field effect transistors (FETs)34,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97.\na Biological synapse and neural network (including three components: receptor, axon and synapse). b Artificial synapse and neural network (including three components: sensor, pathway, and memory)\nEmerging 2D materials (such as graphene, transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs), and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)) have demonstrated excellent properties to realize various functions of biological synapses35,36,76,77,93,94,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105. The atomic structures of these 2D materials provide high integration, suppressed short-channel effects and low leakage currents. Their unique 2D layered structures lead to large surface-to-volume ratios to sensitively perceive external stimulus signal changes. In addition, stacked 2D materials can act as channels with variable energy band structures84,106,107,108,109. In recent years, 2D material synaptic devices have attracted broad research interest (Fig. 2) for extensive applications. Their outstanding and stable mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties enable them to serve as artificial synaptic devices with high stability and low-power consumption16,26,30,36,38,73,74,110,111,112,113,114,115,116,117,118,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128.\nAdapted with permission113.

Copyright 2019, John Wiley and Sons\nIn this article, we summarize recent research on artificial synapses based on 2D materials. First, we introduce various three-terminal synaptic devices with different operating principles, including the biomimetic principles of floating gate-regulated transistors, ferroelectric layer transistors, optoelectronic synaptic transistors, and electromechanical coupling transistors32,33. Second, we focus on the current development of artificial synapse properties excited by electrical, optical, mechanical, and hybrid stimulation. Third, we enumerate advanced applications of artificial synapses to mimic biological neural behaviors129. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of artificial synapses are outlined.\nThree-terminal synaptic devices\nSynaptic devices can be classified as two-, three- and multiple-terminal devices depending on the number of terminals. Typical devices with two terminals can be divided into magnetic random-access memories (MRAM), resistive random-access memories (RRAM), and phase-change memories (PCM)130,131,132. The electrical signal transmission and material resistance strength can be regulated by electrical signals between two electrodes.\nIn contrast, triple-ended synaptic devices can obtain additional regulation provided by the third terminal. The synaptic property of the device can change by applying different voltages at the gate electrode. According to the various modulation mechanisms derived from different functionalized layers coupled with 2D materials, three-terminal artificial synaptic devices can be divided into synapses based on floating gate field effect transistors (FGFETs), ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs), optoelectronic field effect transistors (OFETs), or electromechanical coupling field effect transistors (MFETs), as shown in Fig. 374,133,134,135,136,137,138,139.\naâ€“c Structures of the FGFET, FeFET, optoelectronic field effect transistor, and respectively\nFloating-gate synapses\nThe structure of an FGFET is shown in Fig. 3a. The floating gate layer inserted between the channel layer and gate electrode acts as a charge well, which is isolated by a tunneling and a blocking layer, respectively140.\nThe threshold voltage VT of the FGFET is given by\nwhere QFG and CCG represent the floating gate charge and the capacitance between the control gate (CG) and floating gate (FG), respectively. K is a constant depending on device manufacturing processes.\nWhen a writing gate voltage is applied, charges in the channel can cross over the tunneling layer through the Fowlerâ€“Nordheim (Fâ€“N) tunneling or channel hot electron injection mechanism and be stored in the floating gate layer. Thus, the threshold voltage of the device can be tuned by the QFG when a write/erase operation is performed48,133,134,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148.\nPaul et al. reported a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)-based floating-gate synaptic device using graphene and hBN as the floating-gate and tunneling layers, respectively133. The device maintained an ideal subthreshold swing of 77â€‰mV/decade under over four decades of drain current. In addition, the device, as a biological synapse, successfully simulated the weight update in response to external stimuli by modulating the channel conductance. The high durability (>105â€‰s) and low energy consumption (~5 fJ for a single pulse) of the device laid the foundation for FGFET synapses in neuromorphic applications.\nCompared with conventional dielectric layers, high-k materials are better at suppressing the short-channel effect during device downscaling and can improve the performance of synaptic devices based on FGFETs. For example, Joon Young Kwak and coworkers optimized the thickness of the blocking layer (HfO2) and the tunneling layer (Al2O3) in a MoS2/graphene structure to achieve linear synaptic weight updates149. The device exhibited spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) behavior and demonstrated the possibility of constructing a synaptic device using mass-grown 2D materials, implying a route for spiking neural network (SNN) neuromorphic hardware.\nFerroelectric synapses\nAn FeFET has advantages of fast operating speed, long retention time, large on/off ratios and low-power consumption, making it promising for use in artificial electronic synapses. Ferroelectric materials are low-symmetry crystals, and the specific polarization direction can be formatted under an appropriate external electric field. Due to the nonlinear relationship between the polarization of the ferroelectric material and the applied electric field, a significant electrical hysteresis can be observed in the polarizationâ€“electric field (P-E) loops150,151,152,153,154. Therefore, the polarization state of the ferroelectric layer can be changed by applying an appropriate gate pulse voltage, thus allowing the synapse to be tuned by multidomain polarization switching. In addition, the ferroelectric material can also act as the dielectric layer. Therefore, the gate voltage can modulate the polarization state in real time and influence the channel carrier density, leading to a nonvolatile storage state92,135,136,155,156,157,158,159.\nTian et al. integrated an organic ferroelectric thin film P(VDF-TrFE) as a dielectric layer in a MoS2 FET and obtained a switching ratio of ~104160. Typical biological synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), and STDP, was successfully simulated by the dynamic resistive switching of the device. Due to the polarization flipping ability of the organic ferroelectric material, the device demonstrated low energy consumption (~1 fJ per pulse) and decade-long durability.\nIn addition, Tang et al. constructed a synaptic transistor using an Î±-In2Se3 2D ferroelectric semiconductor as the channel material161. The conductance of the Î±-In2Se3 channel was adjusted by the gate voltage pulse, resulting in a synaptic weight change. The authors simulated basic synaptic behaviors such as single-, paired- and multiple-spike responses by adjusting the gate voltage pulse width. This approach used ferroelectric materials as channel layers and provided a new path for device miniaturization compared with a device using ferroelectric material as the dielectric layer. Wang et al. added more control terminals to the Î±-In2Se3 ferroelectric transistor, realizing nonvolatile storage and implementing neuromorphic computing162. The memory window can reach 6â€‰V and remain stable even after 500 cycles. In addition, the device showed a fast response time and could switch on/off under 40â€‰ns write pulses. In addition, the flexible synaptic plasticity of the device with ~fJ power consumption showed little influence on the nonvolatile memory performance when synaptic weights were updated163.\nOptoelectronic synapses\nOptical detection, processing and memory are fundamental requirements for an artificial vision system. The image capture system was separated from the memory unit for conventional devices. The optoelectronic synapse can realize optical information perception and storage within a single device, enabling the synergistic processing of optical and electrical signals138,164,165,166,167,168. Optoelectronic synapses can simulate synaptic behavior with high energy efficiency, strong robustness, and good parallelism to simulate functions as retinal neurons in human eyes103,137,169,170.\nAccording to a previous study, 2D materials were widely used in photoelectric devices because of their rich energy band structure. Excitons can be produced under optical illumination and be moved inductively by the electric field between the source and drain electrodes. The carrier density in the channel affected the threshold voltage of the device, which exhibited light-tunable synaptic plasticity, as shown in Fig. 3c. Therefore, researchers have sought to achieve continuous, reversible and nonvolatile responses based on photoelectric synapses, leading to visual neural computing applications.\nSeo et al. constructed an optical nerve device based on the h-BN/WSe2 structure and realized both synaptic and optical sensing functions30. The conductivity of the WSe2 channel was adjusted by the number of captured electrons in the oxygen plasma-treated h-BN weight control layer. The near-linear weight update performance provided stable conduction states with less than 1% variation. Additionally, the device showed low-power consumption with only 66 fJ under a single spike operation at 0.3â€‰V.\nMoreover, Sun et al. constructed synapses tuned by both optical and electrical stimulation based on the MoS2/h-BN structure171. The ionization and neutralization of intrinsic defects in h-BN can be co-stimulated by both optical and electrical spikes. Therefore, the synaptic weight was enhanced and suppressed, enabling unique bidirectional weig"

Introduction\nIn recent years, researchers have focussed intently on implementing the SNN computing model on the current computational architecture (von Neumann architecture) and demonstrated excellent performance in visual and audio processing.19–29 In this regard, it is worth carrying out more comprehensive reviews on the emerging SNN software.18,30 However, like DNNs or CNNs, these are typically algorithms implementing different computational cores under conventional von Neumann architecture computing units, which limit the potential of the SNN for separating computation, transmission, and storage of the data. As in the brain, which the SNN dedicates to mimic, nerve cells and synapses not only transmit the signal electrically (spikes along axons) and chemically (neurotransmitters in synapses), but learn, compute, and memorize as well.\nAt this juncture, the AI community is confronted with another major challenge – the von Neumann bottleneck. This issue arises from the physically separated processor and memory units in the modern-day computer. While such an architecture could turnaround, in a relatively short time, a general computational job involving low data exchange between the processor and memory, it suffers from considerable time and energy overheads when executing computationally intensive ANN algorithms. The iterative and recursive nature of such algorithms results in a massive data exchange between the serially interfaced processor and memory, creating therefore a speed bottleneck. While outstanding algorithm optimization work by computer scientists31,32 has offered some respite, innovative hardware solutions are now deemed mandatory in view of the imminent data explosion in the current internet-of-things era.\nThe capability of the human brain in processing massive amounts of data in real time at a minute fraction of the energy cost of the most advanced computers has continued to amaze neuroscientists. In the pursuit of an efficient hardware platform for ANNs, the human brain therefore naturally serves as the golden guide. Attempts to extend existing digital circuit design methodologies to mimic the functionality of neurons and synapses in the biological neural network (CMOS-based SNN) have proven futile because of the large footprints and high energy cost of the resultant circuitries.33–35 Thus, the last few years have seen an intensive amount of research effort being directed toward developing alternative building blocks, commonly termed neuromorphic devices, that are both size and energy efficient, dedicated for implementing a neuromorphic-device-based SNN, the scope of which was reviewed by Marković et al. who discussed the underlying physics,36 Wang et al. who examined the material dependencies,37 and Zhang et al. who investigated the chip level implementation.38 Their works have envisioned a framework of the neuromorphic computing system, where neuromorphic devices will be the foundation.\nTherefore, this review paper focuses on and summarizes recent major progress in building block neuromorphic devices. As similarly employed by Demise et al., terms “neuroscience” and “AI” are used to differentiate the biological/artificial intelligence,30 we carefully use “biological” for discussions on the study of the brain, biological neurons and synapses, and their relative behaviours and the term “neuromorphic” for discussions in the domain of electronic devices dedicated to emulate the function of the brain, and biomaterial is not within the scope of this work. This review is organized as follows: in Section II, we review the basic operation of the biological neural network. Since the exact function of the brain is still a subject of continuing research, only essential concepts that underpin current efforts towards a neuromorphic computer are emphasized. Section III details strategies that have been adopted in the current transition phase from von Neumann to a fully neuromorphic architecture. In Section IV, we compare various promising neuromorphic memristive candidates for artificial neurons and synapses. These devices are benchmarked according to their action energy and standby power consumption and spike timing. Section V concludes and presents challenges that remain to be tackled in this major shift in the computing paradigm, highlights potential guidelines for device design, and provides an outlook on the promising neural network level applications.\n2. Biological neural network\nA. Basic functions of the biological neuron\nIn 1943, McCulloch and Pitts captured the accumulative function of the biological neuron that led to the eventual firing of an action potential into a mathematical model known as the McCulloch–Pitts neuron,1 which was the first spiking neuron model ever proposed. In 1952, Hodgkin and Huxley presented a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of membrane potential under the concerted actuation of multiple ion channels.41 However, the resultant model, comprising several differential equations, is too complex. Some neuron modelling work, therefore, focused on simplicity, representing the overall function using lumped circuit components, e.g., the integrate-and-fire neuron42 (described by a membrane capacitance C) and improved leaky integrate-and-fire or LIF neuron43–45 (described by a parallel RC circuit). In the LIF neuron model, the shunt resistor R is used to account for the loss of ionic charge from the neuron in-between voltage spikes. Another noteworthy model is the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neuron,46–48 capable of describing numerous known firing patterns, e.g., bursting, delayed spike initiation, fast spiking, etc. A comprehensive review on different neuron models can be found in Burkitt et al.49\nB. Basic function of the biological synapse\nSynapses may be classified into two categories, namely chemical and electrical40 (Fig. 1b and c). At an electrical synapse, an incoming voltage spike creates a potential difference between the pre- and post-synaptic neurons and directly induces the flow of a sodium ionic current through the pores or intercellular channels that extend across the synaptic cleft54,55 (Fig. 1c). An electrical synapse can be either unidirectional or bidirectional and has a high transmission speed since the passive current flow across the gap junction is practically instantaneous. The purpose of electrical synapses is to synchronize the firing of a group of neurons to generate a strong stimulus that in turn triggers a crucial response, e.g., a lifesaving reaction. On the other hand, a chemical synapse responds to an action potential via the release of neurotransmitters. Unlike the electrical synapse, a chemical synapse does not have intercellular continuity across the synaptic cleft (Fig. 1b). When neurotransmitters that randomly diffuse across the gap junction are received at the receptor sites on the post-synaptic neuron, ion channels open to allow an inflow of sodium ions that in turn raise the membrane potential of the post-synaptic neuron. Due to the lack of direct transmission paths between the pre- and post-synaptic neurons, the response of a chemical synapse is much slower compared to the electrical counterpart.\nBiological synapses modulate the flow of signals across the biological neural network and are believed to play the role of memory formation in the learning process.40 A strong synaptic connection between two neurons allows almost the entire action potential from the pre-synaptic neuron to be transmitted to the post. On the other hand, a weak synaptic connection suppresses the impact of an action potential on the post-synaptic neuron. Here, we outline a widely accepted theory, known as the Hebbian learning rule,56 which stipulates how the synaptic strength between neurons evolves during the learning process. This rule has thus far closely guided efforts in neuromorphic device development and may be summarized as follows. If a post-synaptic neuron fires a voltage spike after the pre, the latter is said to have directly influenced the depolarization of the former, and the synaptic strength is increased according to the time delay (Δt) between the two firing events (Fig. 1e). The increase is most significant when Δt ∼ 0, i.e., the post-synaptic neuron fires almost immediately after the pre. Conversely, the synaptic strength is reduced if the post-synaptic neuron fires before the pre, i.e., Δt < 0. These synaptic changes linked to the relative timing difference in the firing of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons are widely coined as spiking-time dependent plasticity (STDP).57–66\nWhen there is consecutive firing of pre-/post-synaptic neurons, which may also be referred as excitatory/inhibitory spiking events, the synapse would progress towards long-term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD), as shown in Fig. 1f, respectively, for excitatory or inhibitory events, with the degree of the change depending on the time difference between the pre- and post-synaptic neuron spikes. In 1992, Dan and Poo proved in biological neuromuscular synapses that immediate and long-term depression happens when the postsynaptic pulses alone or the pre-synaptic spike is asynchronous, whereas synchronous pre- and postsynaptic spikes have no effects.59 To be precise, the synapse will be weakened if there are only post-synaptic spikes, or the pre-synaptic spikes happen only after the post-synaptic spikes. Such a biological observation was then confirmed by Debanne et al. in a hippocampal slice two years later.60 Afterwards, it was also found in rat hippocampal neurons that LTP happens if repetitive post-synaptic spikes occur within 20 ms of the pre-synaptic activation.62\nAlternatively, when only one or a few such events happen, the STDP rule will simplify to short-term potentiation (STP) or depression (STD), as shown in Fig. 1g, which shows the change from rest potential to action potential and back to rest potential on neuron membranes, without persistent change in the synaptic strength. Therefore, the major difference between short-term potentiation/depression and long-term potentiation/depression lies in whether the synaptic plasticity is permanently changed during the spiking activities.\n3.

Logical computing based on the von Neumann structure cannot meet the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, because the architecture of memory and processor separation not only increases the time to process information, but also causes huge energy consumption. Compared with traditional computer systems, artificial neural networks can mimic the basic functions of human brain neurons and perform efficient data processing in a distributed, parallel and event-driven manner, which is an important means to break the â€œvon Neumann bottleneckâ€� and realize a new generation of artificial intelligence computer2.\nArtificial synaptic devices are one of the core hardware of neuromorphic computing systems, which have abilities to reveal massively parallel, efficient and high-speed, and handle non-structural problems3. Compared with electronic synaptic devices, photonic synaptic devices are driven by optical signals to realize synaptic functions, which have the advantages of fast, high bandwidth, low crosstalk and low power consumption4,5. More importantly, photonic synaptic devices respond to and process light signals directly and can process visual and image information directly, so they can be used to simulate the function of human retina. If combined with other neural components, they can form a visual neural network and realize an artificially simulated neuromorphic visual system. Therefore, developing a new type of high-performance photonic synaptic device with â€œstorage and computation integrationâ€� is important to realize an artificial intelligence system based on a photonic neural network6,7,8.\nDifferent artificial synapse prototypes have been successfully constructed in recent years based on low-dimensional materials9, organic materials10,11, and perovskites12,13. In 2015, Kang et al.9 investigated the effect of self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-based doping on the performance of WSe2- and MoS2- based transistors and photodetectors, the responsibility reached 1.45â€‰Ã—â€‰104â€‰A/W. Deng et al.10 demonstrated a new organic photosynaptic device in 2019, which featured synaptic and optical-sensing functions in a single device. This device successfully avoided the use of sophisticated device architectures and had a power consumption of 150 Î¼W/cm2. In 2021, Zhu et al.13 presented a flexible optoelectronic sensor array of 1024 pixels using a combination of carbon nanotubes and perovskite quantum dots as active materials for an efficient neuromorphic vision system. The device exhibited a high sensitivity to light of 5.1â€‰Ã—â€‰107â€‰A/W. However, photonic synapse, one of the key components, is still suffering high power consumption, potentially limiting its applications in an artificial neural system.\nNow, writing in this issue of Light: Science & Applications, Anlian Pan and colleagues at the Hunan University report a BP/CdS artificial photonic synapse with ultra-low power consumption14. The device shows a remarkable negative light response with maximum responsivity up to 4.1â€‰Ã—â€‰108â€‰A/W at VDâ€‰=â€‰0.5â€‰V and light power intensity of 0.16â€‰Î¼W/cm2 (1.78â€‰Ã—â€‰108â€‰A/W on average). Moreover, the device enables artificial synaptic applications with average power consumption as low as 4.78 fJ for each training process, representing the lowest among the reported results.\nIn this work, Anlian Pan and co-authors present an artificial photonic synapse structure based on BP/CdS van der Waals heterojunction (Fig. 1), where the CdS and BP are utilized as the photo-sensing layer and channel layer, respectively. Optical spikes are used as triggers thus driving the synaptic device. In this structure, a large number of electron-hole pairs will be generated in CdS flake with electrons flowing into BP and holes trapped in CdS due to the interface barrier between BP and CdS, and the defects and surface states in CdS. It should be pointed out that since both BP and CdS exhibit positive photoresponse, the negative photoresponse should be reasonably originated from the heterojunction caused by defect trapping or molecular adsorption.\nSchematic view of biological synapse and designed artificial synaptic device\nThis device exhibits good performance as follows: Firstly, it can be concluded that the responsivity of the BP/CdS HJ-FET is the highest among the reported devices so far10,11,12,13,14. Secondly, the trapped holes can be well maintained in CdS when the light illumination is removed, leading to a small current state being well kept in the channel. This charge storage behavior is similar to the long-term plasticity in biological synapse and is a prerequisite to ensure reliable study on the synaptic photoresponse. Thirdly, the results indicate that both light illumination time, intensity and different light pulse number can effectively modulate the synapse behavior, which enables the photonic synaptic device application.\nWith the presented work, the authors fabricate an artificial photonic synapse, by which typical photonic synaptic behaviors can be effectively modulated under the synergistic effect of light pulses and electrical pulses, including photosensitivity, postsynaptic photocurrents and persistent photoconductivity. They have also monitored the long-term potentiation (LTP) behavior of the synapse at 450â€‰nm light pulse with different light stimulation information, including illumination time and intensity, revealing that longer light exposure time will effectively enhance the stimulus effect, leading to larger â€“Î”PSC. In addition, the -Î”PSC increases linearly with increasing the pulse number at first and then tends to saturate at a definite value with a fixed gate voltage. Thus LTP and electrical-response-driven long-term depression are successfully simulated based on the synergistic effect of optical programming and electrical erasing in the artificial synapse. The results reveal that the device can be switched well between the program and erase state with >150 cycles over 3000â€‰s. Moreover, the authors simulate the potentiation and depression processes continuously by applying consecutive light and VG spikes, reflecting repeatable switching and good endurance performance of the device. Furthermore, a fully connected optoelectronic neural network (FONN) based on the typical optoelectronic synaptic behavior of the artificial photonic synapse is constructed to evaluate the accuracy of image recognition for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) handwriting image dataset. The results show that maximum recognition accuracy of 94.1% can be achieved after training.\nThe artificial photonic synapse exhibits photonic potentiation and electronic depression behaviors, indicating that the artificial synaptic devices support optical-write and electronic-erase functions for learning and recognition in artificial neural networks. This study provides a new concept for the designing of energy-efficient artificial photonic synapses and shows great potential in high-performance neuromorphic vision systems. We can expect that the performance of the proposed scheme can be further promoted by reducing power consumption of the photonic synapse, improving the recognition accuracy to higher sensitivity and increasing the device integration, this device will be widely applied for the development of photonic synaptic devices including memristors, field-effect transistors, and phase change memory15,16,17. Therefore, it will provide a promising application of 2D heterojunctions for neuromorphic computation, machine vision and artificial intelligence systems.\nReferences\nLiu, C. et al.

An artificial synapse is a fundamental core technology of artificial sensory nerves that can emulate functional properties of a biological synapse. Use of artificial synapses reduces the energy consumption and increases the sensitivity of low-level perception in artificial sensory nerves. Wearable and implantable devices require artificial sensory nerves that are flexible and stretchable. Therefore, development of organic artificial synapses that have these qualities is a central focus in nervetronics. Here, we review the concept and mechanism of organic artificial synapses for use as basic elements of flexible and stretchable artificial nerves. Next, we outline the research direction of the flexible and stretchable artificial sensory nerves so far, and finally, identify challenges of artificial sensory nerves that must be solved to enable actual application of this developing technology.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\nto check access.\nAccess this article\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\nInstitutional subscriptions\n© 2019 Elsevier.

The limitations of the von Neumann architecture, which separates memory from processing units, have prompted the exploration of new frontiers in artificial intelligence.\nCollaborations between physicists and neuroscientists are at the forefront of these developments, uniting diverse expertise to create novel solutions for neuromorphic computing. A new publication from Opto-Electronic Science discusses light-stimulated adaptive artificial synapse based on nanocrystalline metal-oxide film.\nThe human brain's remarkable efficiency is attributed to its spiking mode of information transmission and the seamless integration of information and memory within its neural units. These principles have inspired the development of spiking neural networks (SNNs), offering low-power, high-data-processing solutions for artificial intelligence tasks. Such interdisciplinary collaborations have enabled the infusion of neuroscience principles into the design of neuromorphic systems, making them more biologically plausible.\nNeuroscientists bring their profound understanding of the brain's operation to the table, guiding physicists in the development of materials and devices that mimic the behavior of biological synapses. Their insights into synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory play a pivotal role in shaping the direction of this research. This cross-disciplinary synergy opens the possibility of using neuromorphic approaches to simulate and test a number of neurobiological hypotheses using artificial synapses.\nThe usage of optical signals for transmission of synaptic spikes between neurons is a significant innovation, one that has been made possible through the collaborative work of physicists and neuroscientists. Optoelectronic approaches, guided by the knowledge of neural signal transmission, could reduce heat losses and enable a multitude of network connections and high-rate spike transmission. These advances, driven by the combined expertise of physicists and neuroscientists, offer a promising avenue for future developments in neuromorphic computing.\nIn this context, this paper introduces a groundbreaking light-stimulated adaptive artificial synapse based on a nanocrystalline zinc oxide film. This collaborative effort showcases the fusion of physics and neuroscience, as the material properties are fine-tuned to replicate neural behavior. The result is an artificial synapse that efficiently transmits and processes information, drawing from the knowledge of both physicists and neuroscientists. This interdisciplinary approach not only propels neuromorphic computing forward but also deepens our understanding of the brain's remarkable capabilities.\nIn this study, a group of scientists led by Professor Andrey Fedyanin of the Faculty of Physics of Moscow State University, using the materials science expertise of colleagues from the Faculty of Chemistry, was able to demonstrate biosimilar properties for optoelectric structures based on zinc oxide.\nAs a result of a thoughtful discussion of the possibilities of optoelectric structures with Konstantin Anokhin, a neuroscientist, Academician of the Russian Academy of Science and Director of the Institute for Advanced Brain Studies, Lomonosov Moscow State University it was possible to frame a set of experiments that exposed the spike properties of artificial synapses and demonstrated the effects of adaptation. This research was achievable only due to established interdepartmental relationships at Lomonosov Moscow State University.\nThe development of an adaptive artificial synapse based on a nanocrystalline zinc oxide film represents a significant leap in the field of neuromorphic computing. This artificial synapse not only replicates essential properties of biological synapses but also offers unique advantages in terms of energy efficiency and versatility.\nThe photoconductivity of this zinc oxide-based artificial synapse exhibits spike-type signal responses, closely resembling the behavior of biological synapses. This means it can efficiently transmit and process information in a manner akin to how neurons communicate with one another.\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of this artificial synapse is its memory capabilities. It possesses both short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM), a crucial feature for many cognitive tasks. This LTM is maintained for an extended duration, making it a valuable resource for information storage and retrieval in neuromorphic systems.\nThe transition from STM to LTM is a pivotal milestone in the development of artificial synapses, and this nanocrystalline zinc oxide film-based synapse successfully achieves it. This transition is a key feature in biological synapses and has now been replicated in an artificial system, bringing us closer to emulating the cognitive processes of the human brain.\nAnother remarkable property of this artificial synapse is its paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). This phenomenon, where the second pulse elicits a stronger response than the first, is a critical feature in neural systems and has significant implications for information processing and learning.\nFurthermore, this artificial synapse retains memory from previous exposures, a feature essential for continuous learning and adaptation. This ability to store and retrieve past information allows it to adapt to changing conditions and enhance its performance over time.\nPerhaps the most exciting aspect of this paper is the development of spike-frequency adaptation. This property, common in biological neurons, allows the artificial synapse to adjust its response based on the frequency of incoming signals. This adaptation provides a level of complexity and versatility that is essential for emulating the intricate functioning of the human brain.\nIn summary, the nanocrystalline zinc oxide film-based adaptive artificial synapse marks a significant step toward creating neuromorphic computing systems that replicate the efficiency and adaptability of the human brain. Its ability to reproduce fundamental synaptic behaviors, including STM, LTM, PPF, and spike-frequency adaptation, makes it a promising candidate for future neuromorphic chips and sensorics systems. This development not only showcases the potential for light-stimulated synaptic devices but also opens the door to more advanced and biologically inspired computational technologies.\nMore information:\nIgor S.

Here, inspired by the working mechanism of the G-protein-linked receptor of biological cells, a novel double-layer memristive device with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets covered by chitosan (an ionic conductive polymer) as the channel material is constructed. The protons in chitosan and the functional groups in rGO nanosheets imitate the functions of the ligands and receptors of biological cells, respectively. Smooth changes in the response current depending on the historical applied voltages are observed, offering a promising pathway toward biorealistic synaptic emulation. The memristive behavior is mainly a result of the interaction between protons provided by chitosan and the defects and functional groups in the rGO nanosheets. The channel current is due to the hopping of protons through functional groups and is limited by the traps in the rGO nanosheets. The transition from short-term to long-term potentiation is achieved, and learning-forgetting behaviors of the memristor mimicking those of the human brain are demonstrated. Overall, the bioinspired memristor-type artificial synaptic device shows great potential in neuromorphic networks.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nHigh sensitivity and wide response range artificial synapse based on polyimide with embedded graphene quantum dots\nLijie Kou, Nan Ye, â€¦ Fushan Li\nFlexible organic synaptic device based on poly (methyl methacrylate):CdSe/CdZnS quantum-dot nanocomposites\nBon Min Koo, Sihyun Sung, â€¦ Tae Whan Kim\nHydrophobically gated memristive nanopores for neuromorphic applications\nGonÃ§alo Paulo, Ke Sun, â€¦ Alberto Giacomello\nIntroduction\nInspired by the massive parallelism, robust computation, fault tolerance, and energy efficiency of the human brain, neuromorphic computing has attracted a tremendous upsurge of research interest since synaptic behaviors were mimicked by Mead in 1996 using a floating-gate silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor1,2,3,4,5. The implementation of neural networks at the software level with algorithms, such as Googleâ€™s Alpha Go and IBM Watson, based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor technology requires a large amount of resources6. In addition, the tremendous amount of data processing between the memory and the central processing unit with a conventional von Neumann architecture limits the speed of current computer systems7. However, the human brain, containing ~1011 neurons and 1015 synapses, only consumes less than 20â€‰W, making it more efficient than any other computing system8. Therefore, a computing system that can potentially emulate the neuromorphic network and overcome the von Neumann bottleneck is critically required. Memristors acting as a synapse unit, resembling their biological counterpart in terms of structure, can emulate several functions of the synaptic behaviors of the human brain. In addition, memristor-based artificial synapses can be used as basic building blocks to achieve large-scale neural network parallelism.\nThus, a great amount of attention has been attracted and much effort has been made to improve the performance of memristors. Generally, memristors are a type of two-terminal device with a layer of memristive material sandwiched between metal electrodes in either a vertical or planar structure. The working mechanism of the devices is highly related to the selection of both memristive and electrode materials. Recently, binary metal oxides, oxide perovskites, polymers, and 2D materials have been widely used as memristive layers in the construction of memristors9,10,11,12. Each category of material has advantages in terms of the working mechanism and the material properties, which is beneficial to applications in specific areas with the suitable selection of the materials. According to different working mechanisms, memristors can be categorized into filament-type and barrier-type devices8. With regard to filament-type memristors, the conductance of the devices is controlled by the formation and rupture of the filament. Undesired abrupt conductance changes and cycle-to-cycle variation are observed due to the random distribution of the filaments in the insulator caused by the stochastic nature of ion migration13. Different from filament-type memristors, barrier-type memristors generally modulate the conductance states by the defect effect, which can overcome the electroforming randomness, ensuring reproducibility, and device-to-device uniformity14,15. In addition, a series of continuous conductance states capable of emulating biosynaptic functions can be modulated by external stimuli. Therefore, use of the barrier-type memristor is considered a more suitable approach to emulate synaptic behaviors.\nBased on the above analysis, the design of memristive devices, whose conductance states can be modulated by the defect effect, is a strategy to emulate biorealistic synaptic behaviors. In addition, the high efficiency of information processing and transmission in biological nervous systems provides an approach to designing memristive devices with high performance based on the metrics of biological systems. For example, a double-layer memristive device can be conceived based on inspiration from the working mechanism and structure of the G-protein-linked receptors of biological cells16,17, in which neural signals are transmitted by ligands from the extracellular environment in conjunction with receptors from transmembrane proteins located in the cytomembrane. In the designed device, mobile carriers provided by the top layer are able to mimic the functions of the ligands from the extracellular environment, while functional groups and defects in the bottom layer can behave like the receptors from transmembrane proteins. However, to the best of our knowledge, emulation of synaptic behaviors using this bioinspired working mechanism has not been reported even though the use of various materials, such as binary oxides, polymers, and perovskites, has been attempted in the fabrication of memristive devices9,11,18,19.\nHerein, we designed and fabricated a double-layer memristive device in which chitosan (CS), an abundant, nontoxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible polymer, was selected as the top-layer material due to its electronic insulation and proton conduction properties20. The protons, hopping between the channel layers, behave like the ligands of biological cells. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets were used as the bottom-layer material, and the functional groups and defects in the nanosheets behave like the receptors of biological cells. The number of functional groups and defects in the rGO nanosheets can be well controlled by tuning the degree of the chemical redox reaction21,22. As a result, the device exhibits history-dependent memristive behaviors with continuous changes in the conductance states, meeting the fundamental requirements for mimicking the functions of a biological synapse. Consequently, a series of synaptic characteristics, including short-term potentiation (STP), long-term potentiation (LTP), spike-rate-dependent plasticity (SRDP), and learning-forgetting behaviors, toward biorealistic synaptic emulation were successfully realized.\nResults and discussion\nDevice structure and properties\nFigure 1a shows the schematic diagrams for two neurons connected by a synapse in the nervous system and the corresponding working mechanism. Transmission of synaptic signals between neurons is a complex process that starts with the opening of voltage-controlled ion channels by external stimuli23. In brief, the diffusion of Ca2+ ions leads to the release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles, and the ions bind to the receptor sites of Na+-gated ion channels at postsynaptic neurons. As a result, the Na+-gated ion channels will open, and Na+ can diffuse inside the cell, which leads to a positively charged membrane potential. The neuron will fire an action potential once the membrane potential reaches the threshold. This process contributes to the information flow and signal processing of the nervous system24. Based on the structure and types of receptors (acceptors), the synapses in the biological system can be classified into various categories. Taking the G-protein-linked receptor as an example, the ligands from the extracellular environment react with the receptors from transmembrane proteins located in the cytomembrane (circled by the red dashed lines in Fig. 1a-II), and an ionic channel is formed to transmit the signals. Inspired by the working principle of the G-protein-linked receptor, a double-layer memristive device consisting of rGO and CS as bottom-layer and top-layer materials, respectively, was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 1b. In the designed memristive device, the protons in CS and the functional groups in rGO are able to imitate the functions of the ligands and receptors of biological cells, respectively. Thus, the synaptic behavior can be mimicked using this device by monitoring the conductance change of the memristor. The detailed fabrication process and related parameters are included in Supplementary Figs. S1â€“S3. In addition, to emulate the neuromorphic functions of the brain, a matrix of the designed double-layer memristor was fabricated, and the optical image is presented in Fig. 1c. After fabrication of the devices, the currentâ€“voltage (IV) characteristics of the devices with rGO, CS, and rGO covered with CS as the channel materials were investigated, as presented in Fig. 1d, e, f, respectively. No hysteresis in the IV curves is observed for the devices with rGO or CS as the channel material, and the conductance is independent of the applied voltage. Regarding the device with rGO/CS as the channel material, a hysteretic IV characteristic is obtained, which is a main feature of memristive devices. The results imply the occurrence of an interaction between the CS membrane and rGO nanosheets, which leads to the change in device conductance being dependent on the applied voltages. In addition, the bend test shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 indicates the flexibility and mechanical reliability of the devices.\na-I Schematic diagram for the connection of two neurons by a synapse in the biological system and a-II the working principle of the G-protein-linked receptor. b Schematic diagram and c optical image of the flexible memristors. CS and rGO were used as the top and bottom layers of the device channels, respectively. IV characteristics for the devices with d rGO, e CS, and f rGO covered by CS as the channel materials\nPhysical and electrical characteristics\nTo explore the underlying mechanism of the memristive behaviors of the device, the physical and electrical properties of the rGO nanosheets, the CS membrane and the interactions between them were investigated in detail. From the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. 2aâ€“d, there are many nanoholes in the rGO nanosheets, with an average size of ~1â€‰Î¼m, which lead to a number of defects (more information about the size and thickness of the nanosheets is presented in Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6). In this research, since the channel length of the fabricated device is 40â€‰Î¼m and the size of the rGO nanosheets is ~1â€‰Î¼m, it can be inferred that there are a number of homojunctions caused by overlaps of the nanosheets and intersecting grain boundaries in the channel. The homojunctions and grain boundaries as well as the defects inside the rGO nanosheets work as traps and impede the flow of current through the channel. By contrast, from the XPS spectra shown in Supplementary Fig. S7, a considerable number of functional groups are observed in the rGO nanosheets, which will contribute to the current induced by the hopping of the carriers in the channel25,26,27. In addition, from the comparison of the FTIR spectra for CS and rGO/CS in Fig. 2e, obvious changes in the bands at 1628â€“1633â€‰cmâˆ’1 and 1524â€“1529â€‰cmâˆ’1 are observed; these bands are assigned to amide I and antisymmetric â€“NH3+ deformation and to amide II and â€“Nâ€“H bending vibrations, respectively28. Thus, the changes are considered to be caused by the protonation of amide, which is also supported by the N 1s peaks of the XPS spectra shown in Fig. 2f, indicating that the extent of protonation of amine groups increases from 2.96 to 14.25%. No obvious change in the C 1s peaks is observed for the XPS spectra collected from the CS and CS/rGO samples, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S8. Furthermore, the increased conductance of the devices with humidity (Supplementary Fig. S9) is additional evidence for the above analysis, as the extent of protonated amino groups of CS is influenced by the ambient humidity29,30.\naâ€“d AFM images and the corresponding heights of rGO nanosheets. rGO nanosheets with an average size of ~1â€‰Î¼m were obtained. e Comparison of FTIR spectra for rGO, CS, and rGO/CS samples. Changes arising from antisymmetric â€“NH3+ deformation and â€“Nâ€“H bending vibrations were observed. The (f) N 1s peak in the XPS spectra shows that extent of protonation of amine groups increases from 2.96 to 14.25% for CS and rGO/CS samples. g, h demonstrate the forward and reverse IV curves of the memristor plotted in log scale, which are governed by SCLC\nBased on the above results, it can be inferred that the current in the channel is caused by the hopping of protons through the functional groups27,31. The hopping process resembles the interaction between the ligands and receptors in biological systems. In other words, the formation of current based on ionic dynamics in the memristor is similar to the working mechanism of G-protein-linked receptors. In contrast, traps formed by the grain boundaries, homojunctions, and defects will capture the carriers and impede the current, as mentioned above32. From the slopes of the IV curve in regions I and II of Fig. 2g, as the voltage increases, the current changes from the low-exponent space-charge-limited current (SCLC) affected by shallow traps to the high-exponent SCLC affected by deep traps.

This is primarily due to the extensive parallel processing done in our human brain. Data processing and logical decision-making at the same physical location are an exciting aspect of neuromorphic computation. For this, establishing reliable resistive switching devices working at room temperature with ease of fabrication is important. Here, a reliable analog resistive switching device based on Au/NiO nanoparticles/Au is discussed. The application of positive and negative voltage pulses of constant amplitude results in enhancement and reduction of synaptic current, which is consistent with potentiation and depression, respectively. The change in the conductance resulting in such a process can be fitted well with double exponential growth and decay, respectively. Consistent potentiation and depression characteristics reveal that non-ideal voltage pulses can result in a linear dependence of potentiation and depression. Long-term potentiation (LTP) and Long-term depression (LTD) characteristics have been established, which are essential for mimicking the biological synaptic applications. The NiO nanoparticle-based devices can also be used for controlled synaptic enhancement by optimizing the electric pulses, displaying typical learning-forgetting-relearning characteristics.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nA multi-timescale synaptic weight based on ferroelectric hafnium zirconium oxide\nMattia Halter, Laura BÃ©gon-Lours, â€¦ Bert Jan Offrein\nGate Tuning of Synaptic Functions Based on Oxygen Vacancy Distribution Control in Four-Terminal TiO2âˆ’x Memristive Devices\nZenya Nagata, Takuma Shimizu, â€¦ Akira Sakai\nImplementation of threshold- and memory-switching memristors based on electrochemical metallization in an identical ferroelectric electrolyte\nChansoo Yoon, Gwangtaek Oh, â€¦ Bae Ho Park\nIntroduction\nThe last few decades have seen tremendous technological advancement, thanks to the capability of fabricating smaller and smaller electronic devices for various applications. The manufacturing of high-density architecture is borrowed from the ideas of Allen Turing, who proposed computation using serial instructions. The von Neuman architecture puts forward a more successful route for information storage and information processing with both storage and processing occurs are separate physical locations1. The von Neuman architecture not only has an information processing time but also has energy consumption limitations. Since the complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology, popularly known as CMOS technology is reaching its lowest limit, newer and superior technology is expected to become prominent in the future with better performance. It has been proved over the years that device scaling alone will not solve the problem of processing time and energy consumption. The continuous exchange of information between the memory unit and the processing unit has its limitation referred to as the von Neumann bottleneck, which ultimately will become the reason for the limit for miniaturization. With the exponential growth of data availability and the requirement of big data processing, the fundamental limitation of processing speed and energy efficiency has posed doubt on the success of von Neumann architecture for the future of information processing and computing devices.\nTo overcome the limitations set by the von Neuman architecture, we need better and efficient design of the electronic architecture and to do that we can get inspiration from the human brain. Here, information storage and processing occur at the same physical location, which completely removes the necessity of information passage which is time and energy-consuming2. At the core of brain operation, there is a pre-synaptic area (neuron) and a post-synaptic area (neuron) connected with a controlling synapse. The synapse tunes the strength of the connection between the two synaptic terminals. The information storage and processing occur completely differently in this neuronâ€“synapseâ€“neuron (Nâ€“Sâ€“N) combination. In addition, the working of a human brain is characterized by massive parallel connections of neurons which results in parallel computing with the highest energy efficiency3. In this regard, there are efforts to fabricate solid-state devices which can mimic the working principle of a fundamental unit of the human brain. Such device fabrication is intended to store memory and process the information in the same physical location, which will replicate the basic functionalities of the brain, such as learning and memory (short-term and long-term). Thus, the â€˜Brain inspiredâ€™ or â€™Neuromorphicâ€™ computing could potentially revolutionize electronics and computing devices in the future4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19.\nThe fundamental unit of the human brain can be a simple neuronâ€“synapseâ€“neuron (Nâ€“Sâ€“N) system. The neurons transmit the signals and the synapse either amplifies or reduces the signal which is to be transmitted from one neuron to the other. It is estimated that the human brain consists of approximately 10\\(^{11}\\) neurons and \\(\\approx\\) 10\\(^{15}\\) synapses with the parallel interconnection of extremely high density20,21,22,23,24,25,26. Each neuron is interconnected with hundreds of other neurons using synapses. The ability of the synapses to tune the strength or amplitude of the connection between the neurons is the basic idea of learning and the memory. Interesting to note that both learning and memory happen in the synapse which is the key point in the working principle of the neuronâ€“synapseâ€“neuron system. That means one needs to find an equivalent electronic device that can modulate its conduction state and also have memory functionalities suitable for mimicking the Nâ€“Sâ€“N system. In the last decade, extensive research has been done to emulate the biological neurons and â€˜artificialâ€™ synapse and understand the basic memory functionalities13,14,15,16,17,18,19. One of the simplest device structure which can show the memory and processing at the same location is memristor27. In its simple geometry, a memristor is a two-terminal device where an insulating material is sandwiched between the two metal electrodes. One can emulate the fundamental operation of neuronâ€“synapseâ€“neuron system using this simple geometry containing an insulating material sandwiched between two electrodes. The metal electrodes will send and receive the information and sandwiched layer will store and process the information. The special feature of the insulating layer is that it can retain various resistance states depending on the training procedure using voltage or current, making sure that the information is stored at different levels. The ability to retain different conductance levels by memristor precisely compares well with the Nâ€“Sâ€“N operation with various synaptic weights in biological synapses. Many efforts have been put into fabricating a replica of the Nâ€“Sâ€“N-like device in the laboratory. There are mainly two types of devices that can emulate the Nâ€“Sâ€“N functions. (i) the metalâ€“oxideâ€“metal (Mâ€“Iâ€“M) combination in the form of vertical or lateral device geometry or, simply, a two-terminal device. Here, the conductance state of the device is mapped with applied voltage. (ii) a transistor geometry or a three-terminal device. In this case, the third terminal acts as a control gate. With this design, the channel conductance can be controlled/tuned much more efficiently. It has been established now that the conductance states change abruptly (digital switching) or gradually (analog switching) depending on the switching material considered.\nResistive switching phenomena has been studied in a variety of materials such as binary oxides like HfO\\(_{2}\\), CeO\\(_{2}\\), TaO\\(_{2}\\), TiO\\(_{2}\\), CrO\\(_{2}\\), SiO\\(_{2}\\), Ga\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{3}\\) and ZnO, NbO\\(_{2}\\) and perovskite oxides such as SrTiO\\(_{3}\\) and spinel oxides such as NiFe\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{4}\\), CoFe\\(_{2}\\)O\\(_{4}\\), Zn\\(_{2}\\)SnO\\(_{4}\\)23,28,29, Chalcogenide based thin film devices, carbon-based materials, and two-dimensional materials such as MoS\\(_{2}\\), h-BN and their heterostructures5,25,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38. During the operation of a memristor, electroforming step is applied at the beginning and then the resistance state is uncontrollably switched between the high-resistance state (HRS) and low-resistance state (LRS). There are mainly two switching categories. (i) unipolar switching, where the magnitude of the electric field determines the resistance state rather than the polarity and (ii) Bipolar switching depends on the polarity of the external electric field.\nThe binary oxide NiO-based thin film devices have been studied extensively for resistance switching. A detailed model for the conduction mechanism in the RRAM cells using NiO has been extensively discussed39,40,41. There are various conduction mechanisms possible in oxide-based memristor devices. Majority of results consider the trap-assisted tunneling (TAT model), space-charge-limited conduction (SCLC), and joule heating as the major conduction mechanisms. Even though the type of conduction mechanisms are still a topic of discussion, the formation and dissolution of conduction filament and/or charge trapping/de-trapping (TAT model) are considered two possible mechanisms of conduction due to the application of the electric field42. There are extensive reports on resistive switching in NiO thin films where the conduction is primarily from the oxygen ion vacancies is considered. The origin of such oxygen vacancies is attributed to the process-induced vacancies, which outnumber vacancies formed during the creation of the conduction filament. NiO grows as Ni-deficient oxide film, and it is found that the oxygen vacancies contribute electrons to the Ni-vacancies. Due to the very high electric field across the conduction filament, oxygen migration can create an oxygen vacancy. This oxygen vacancy will have a +2 charge, giving two localized electrons to the nearby Ni atoms. The two electrons will reduce the Ni\\(^{2+}\\) to Ni\\(^{0}\\), thereby creating a metallic conduction path representing the ON state of the device. If the device structure is such that there is a large difference in the work functions of electrodes and the switching material, then energy band bending near to the interface is expected. Due to the band bending across the interface, trap-assisted tunneling dominates the conduction process. In our case, we have selected the Au electrodes whose work function matches very well with the NiO nanoparticle films43,44. (The work function of NiO nanoparticles and Au is 5.37 eV and 5.38 eV, respectively). This implies our devices should show negligible band bending at the interface of NiO/Au, which is associated with negligible trapping and de-trapping of charge carriers at the interface. In the case of NiO thin films, it is found that the charge compensation of V\\(_{Ni}\\) is the main driving mechanism for the p-type conductivity45. The solution processed NiO\\(_{x}\\) nanoparticles have been successfully used for efficient hole transport layer in organic optoelectronic devices46. There are few reports on NiO thin film-based resistive switching devices and few attempts in using NiO thin film devices for synaptic applications39,40,41,47. A modified Ebbinghaus forgetting curve has been established for NiO thin film memristor with conductance decreasing with time48. Recently, habituation and sensitization properties of NiO-based devices have been studied under the exposure of 5\\(\\%\\) H\\(_{2}\\) exposure40. To our understanding, there are no reports on studies involving resistive switching and the possible usage of NiO nanoparticle thin films for artificial synaptical applications.\nResults\n(a) Schematic diagram of the synthesis procedure of NiO nanoparticles. The details are given in the text. (b) X-ray diffraction spectra of cleaned NiO nanoparticles. The high-intensity peaks have been identified at 2\\(\\theta\\) = 36.9\\(^{\\circ }\\), 42.97\\(^{\\circ }\\) are indexed to (111) and (200) crystallographic planes. (c) The UVâ€“vis spectra converted into a Tauc plot indicate an optical energy gap of 3.72 eV.\nThe purity of the as-synthesized NiO nanoparticles was checked using powder X-ray diffraction. Figure 1b shows a typical x-ray diffraction spectra of as-prepared NiO nanoparticles. The peak positions at 2\\(\\theta\\) = 36.9\\(^{\\circ }\\), 42.97\\(^{\\circ }\\), 62.57\\(^{\\circ }\\), 75.17\\(^{\\circ }\\) and 79.12\\(^{\\circ }\\) are indexed as (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1), and (2 2 2) crystallographic places of bulk NiO, respectively. The diffraction peaks and relative intensities match very well with the face-centered cubic (FCC) phase of NiO (JCPDS, No. 04-0835). It is important to note that the diffraction pattern confirms the pure phase of NiO without any impurity phases. The average crystallite size of the nanoparticles was calculated using Debyeâ€“Scherrerâ€™s equation \\(\\textit{D}\\) = \\(\\frac{K \\lambda }{B \\cos \\theta }\\) , where D represents the crystallite size, K = 0.94 is the Scherrerâ€™s constant of the (hkl) planes of the crystallite; \\(\\lambda\\) is the wavelength of the X-rays. The average crystallite size is \\(\\sim\\)23 nm, as shown in the table(S2). To estimate the optical energy gap, we performed the UV-vis spectroscopy and converted it into a Tauc plot, as shown in Fig. 1c. The extrapolation of the band to the energy axis shows 3.67 eV. A detailed insight into the electronic structure and composition of NiO is derived from the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The survey XPS spectra presented in Fig. 2a, reveal the presence of Nickle and Oxygen. Firstly, we note that there are carbon peaks at 284.52 eV and 288.34 eV as shown in Fig. 2b, respectively, which come from the C-C and C-O bonds. We attribute such carbon peaks as adventitious carbon peaks (AdC) coming from the surface contamination and the handling of the sample during the XPS measurements49. The high-resolution XPS spectra near Fermi energy give us details about the presence of Ni and O, and as shown in Fig. 2c, the peaks of Ni (1â€“2 eV) and a broad peak of O (6â€“10 eV).

Both short-term plasticity (e.g., paired-pulse facilitation) and long-term plasticity (e.g., spike-timing-dependent plasticity) are demonstrated in a single molecular synapse. The dynamic current response is due to a combination of both chemical gating and coordination effects between Ag+ and hosting groups within peptides which adjusts the electron hopping rate through the molecular junction.

Building electronic components using individual or monolayer molecules could be one of the solutions for the fundamental limitations that current complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology faces upon further device miniaturization. Molecular electronic components such as switch6, rectifier (cf. diode)7, transistor8, memory9,10, and basic logic gates11,12 have been created. The development of molecular electronics is still on its way to replacing silicon electronics in which the information is processed based on the von Neumann architecture. However, this architecture separates the computation and memory steps which face great challenges upon explosive growth of data.\nNeuromorphic computing, mimicking the information processing of the brain, could perform complex tasks with massive parallelism and work under Compute-in-Memory mode (pace von Neumann model), thus greatly improving both the computation and energy efficiencies13,14,15. Hardware implementation requires an artificial synapse that could emulate the change of connection strength (cf. synapse weight) between two processing neuros16,17. The electronic artificial synapse in which the synapse weight (cf. conductance) is modulated by electrical stimulus has attracted increasing attention since the seminal works of Leon Chua18 and Hewlett Packard team19 on their finding of memory resistors (memristor). In particular, the electric-field-induced memory phenomena have also been demonstrated by using molecular junctions as components in which the switching of resistance or conductance is dominated by either inherent characteristics of molecules20,21,22,23,24 or electrode-molecule couplings25,26. For example, the redox states10,23 and conformations27 of molecules could be electrically reconfigured, leading to drastically different electronic characters and reversible switching of conductance between two or multiple states. The discrete conductance states and their nonvolatile characteristics are both needed for fabricating large-scale, high-density molecular resistive random-access memory (RRAM) circuits, however, such digital switching performance is not capable of emulating synaptic functions in which the weight changes of molecular junction should be continuously modulated upon electrical pulses.\nIn this article, we report a molecular electronic synapse by sandwiching a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of peptide (11 amino acids) molecules between an active Ag/AgOx electrode and a eutectic alloy of Gallium and Indium (EGaIn) liquid electrode. The electric-field-driven pumping and migrating of Ag+ in peptide molecules could dynamically control the current passing across the junction, enabling us to modulate the synaptic weight and implement typical short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity (STP and LTP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of a molecular artificial synapse within one molecule length scale. This molecular synapse is subsequently used in reservoir computing (RC) systems for recognizing simple sine and square waveforms.\nResults\nMolecular junction synapse\nThe mission to continuously change the conductance of a molecular junction is largely impossible since there are very limited redox states or conformations of the molecule itself. Inspired by the influx and extrusion of Ca2+ in the biological synapse, an active electrode is needed, acting as a reservoir for donating/accepting metal cations into/from molecules. In addition, the molecules should contain functional groups which could interact with metal cations, enabling long-distance migration of cations28. Based on these two requirements, we design the device by using an active Ag/AgOx electrode, an EGaIn (which consists of an ultrathin, highly conductive GaOx layer on the surface) liquid electrode, and a monolayer of peptide molecules stuck in between, Ag/AgOx//peptide//GaOx/EGaIn (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1, and see Supplementary Figs. 2â€“8 for the characterization of the junction). The Ag/AgOx electrode is prepared by partial oxidation of electron-beam evaporated Ag in the air (see â€œMethodsâ€� section for details). This procedure decreases the energy needed for injecting Ag+ into peptide molecules (see below). The peptide molecule contains 11 amino acids (CAAAAKAAAAK, C, A, and K are cysteine, alanine, and lysine) terminated with cysteine, which provides thiol for bonding on the Ag surface. No bonding presents at the top liquid electrode but only physical contact.\na Scheme of the molecular synapse device containing a bottom Ag/AgOx electrode, peptide SAM, and a liquid GaOx/EGaIn top electrode, Ag/AgOx//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn. The Ag/AgOx electrode is prepared by thermal annealing electron-beam evaporated Ag layer (200â€‰nm) at 150â€‰Â°C for 40â€‰min in air. Current signals (black, red, and blue curves) recorded by consecutively placing 75 positive b, negative c, and positive d, triangle pulses (light blue curves, amplitude, 0.45â€‰V, width, 9â€‰s). The bottom Ag/AgOx is grounded. e Device endurance test by placing continuous potentiation (amplitude, âˆ’0.45â€‰V, red markers, left y-axis) and depression (amplitude, 0.45â€‰V, blue markers, right y-axis) pulses for 65 cycles. 30 square pulses (width, 0.5â€‰s) are placed for each potentiation or depression.\nThe electrical characteristics of the molecular junction are then monitored by placing consecutive triangle pulses. When a string of positive pulses is firstly placed on the liquid electrode (the bottom Ag/AgOx electrode is grounded), no apparent change of current is found (Fig. 1b). The slight decrease of current could be probably attributed to the anodic growth of the GaOx layer, reorganization of the SAMs, and deformation of the PDMS top electrodes29,30. However, during the following sequence of negative pulses (with the same amplitude but reversed polarity), there is a dramatic enhancement of current, approximately 20 times increase after 75 triangular pulses (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, the high conductive states could return to the initial low conductive state under another sequence of consecutive positive pulses (Fig. 1d).\nApparently, this field polarity-dependent conductance modulation should be related to the active Ag/AgOx electrode. We propose that the active Ag/AgOx electrode has released Ag+ which enters into the peptide monolayer under negative pulses. This hypothesis is consistent with the artificial synapse or RRAM devices fabricated by using other interlayers31. The influx and extrusion (under positive pulses) of Ag+ are very similar to the behaviors of Ca2+ in bio-synapse. Accordingly, the increase and decrease of conductance (weight) correspond to the emulated synaptic potentiation (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 9, red half) and depression (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 9, blue half). Importantly, this continuous potentiation and depression process could be reversibly switched for up to tens of cycles within a single molecular synapse without apparent performance degradation (Fig. 1e and Supplementary Fig. 10).\nOperation mechanism of the molecular synapse\nTo clarify the dynamics of Ag+ within peptide SAMs, the performance of the active Ag/AgOx electrode is firstly compared with the Ag electrode without thermal annealing (see Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig.6, and Supplementary Fig. 11). In previous reports, stable electrical characteristics of Ag//SAM//GaOx/EGaIn devices are demonstrated, indicating no Ag+ release from the Ag electrode. Supplementary Fig. 6 compares the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of peptide SAM covalently bonded on Ag (red) and Ag/AgOx (blue) electrodes. A pair of redox peaks around 0.3 and 0.2â€‰V appears for Ag/AgOx//peptide device while no apparent peaks are found by using the Ag electrode. This is probably due to the different activation energies required for Ag+ release. Similar consecutive triangle pulses with an amplitude of 1.0â€‰V are placed on the Ag//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn device (see Supplementary Fig. 11aâ€“c). Neither apparent increase (potentiation) nor decrease (depression) in conductance are observed (Supplementary Fig. 11dâ€“j), showing distinct electrical characteristics from Ag/AgOx//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn synapse (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 11râ€“x). In another experiment, peptide SAM is replaced by using a monolayer of dodecanethiol, Ag/AgOx///HS-(CH2)12H//GaOx/EGaIn. The currentâ€“voltage characteristics of this dodecanethiol junction are analogous to that recorded in Ag//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn device (Supplementary Fig. 11kâ€“q). The absence of conductance modulation in these two control devices indicates that both Ag/AgOx active electrode and peptide molecules are indispensable for emulating synapses.\nThe roles of molecules and metal cations on the synaptic behaviors of the junctions are subsequently studied by performing several additional control experiments. Supplementary Fig. 12 shows the electrical characteristics of the Ag/AgOx//C(GABA)(GABA)D(GABA)(GABA)D//GaOx/EGaIn and Ag/AgOx//HS-PEG8-CH2CH2COOH//GaOx/EGaIn devices. Both devices exhibit similar synaptic behavior to the Ag/AgOx//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn junction, however, with relatively lower current change ratios (calculated by Ratio = I80/I1, where I80 (I1) is the measured current peak of the 80th (1st) pulse) under the same potentiation pulse sequences (Supplementary Fig. 11w vs. Supplementary Fig. 12d and Fig. 12h). On the other hand, the electrical characteristics of the Ag//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn junctions doped with Ag+, Na+, and Ca2+ cations (prepared by immersing Ag//CAAAAKAAAAK in AgNO3, NaNO3 and Ca(NO3)2 solution, see Methods section for details) are recorded (Supplementary Fig. 13). All of the cation-doped junctions display a conductance depression in the first sequence of positive pulses which is distinct from the device without metal cation doping (Supplementary Fig. 13 vs. Supplementary Fig. 11d). Interestingly, in the following sequences of negative and positive pulses, the devices show similar synaptic potentiation and depression behaviors. The current change ratios are positively related to the metal cation concentrations. Importantly, since the Na+ or Ca2+ ions are hard to be reduced into the metallic states (amplitude, 1â€‰V), the synaptic properties in these devices are not due to the formation of the metallic filaments31. Instead, it should be attributed to the influence of cations on the electronic states of the peptide molecules. Finally, the temperature-dependent conductance measurements of Ag//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn and Ag//CAAAAKAAAAK-Ag+//GaOx/EGaIn (see â€œMethodsâ€� section for details) devices are performed. The activation energy has decreased from 128 to 36â€‰meV upon binding of Ag+ (see Supplementary Fig. 14), indicating a higher electron hopping rate within the peptide-Ag+ junction.\nTo validate the reproducibility of our devices, a similar statistical analysis with Whitesides and Nijhuis reports is given in Supplementary Fig. 15 and Table S1. The counts of log10|J| at 0.5â€‰V are calculated from the Iâ€“V curves at the stable states. These current density counts of all devices exhibit tight gaussian distributions32,33. In addition, the measurement of HS-(CH2)12H SAMs (<log10|J|â€‰>â€‰~âˆ’2) is consistent with the previous results33,34. The conductance of HS-PEG8-CH2CH2COOH (<log10|J|â€‰>â€‰~âˆ’1.7) is lower than the Au/HS-PEG8-CH3//GaOx/EGaIn junction (<log10|J|â€‰>â€‰~âˆ’1.2)32, which is probably due to the different terminal groups and/or defects in the SAMs35. The junctions of C(GABA)(GABA)D(GABA)(GABA)D (<log10|J|â€‰>â€‰~âˆ’3.1) and CAAAAKAAAAK (<log10|J|â€‰>â€‰~âˆ’2.5) SAMs show similar conductance, which are larger than the value observed in Cys(Gly)9 SAM (<log10|J|â€‰>â€‰~âˆ’5.4) with similar molecular backbones32. Compared to the Cys(Gly)9, the CAAAAKAAAAK molecules assembled on the electrode surface are much more ordered and have a larger tilt angle, which may lead to stronger couplings between the CAAAAKAAAAK and the electrode and enhance the electron transport in the molecular junction.\nAll control experiments suggest the injection of Ag+ from the Ag/AgOx active electrode into the peptide monolayer which influences the electron transport through the peptide molecules. Fig 2a shows the scheme of possible Ag+ release and distribution within the Ag/AgOx//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn synapse device under negative bias. The positively charged Ag+ could not only coordinate to the â€“C=O, â€“NH groups (coordination effect) but also influence the electronic states of functional groups (chemical gating) within peptide molecules36. However, in Ag//CAAAAKAAAAK//GaOx/EGaIn"
